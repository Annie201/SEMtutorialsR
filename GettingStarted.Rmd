Getting started using structural equation modeling (SEM) in R can be daunting. There are 
lots of different packages for implementing SEM in R and there are different features 
of SEM that a user might be interested in implementing. A few packages you might come 
across can be found on the [CRAN Psychometrics Task View](http://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Psychometrics.html). 

For those who want to just dive in the `lavaan` package seems to offer the most 
comprehensive feature set for most SEM users and has a well thought out and easy 
to learn syntax for describing SEM models.
